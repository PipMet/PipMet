\arguments{
\item{myDir}{Path to working directory. Default to none.}

\item{sample_dir}{Path to sample directory. Default to none.}

\item{metadata}{Path to .csv file or an R data.frame object containing metadata. At least 'sample' and 'file' columns must be included. Default to none.}

\item{extension}{Extension of mass spectrometry files to read. Only accepted '.mzML' and '.mzXML'. Default to none.}

\item{pictures}{Logical. If pictures should be plotted or not.}

\item{example}{Logical. If example = TRUE, the metadata and other needed files will be loaded from package files.}

\item{filter}{Numeric. Intensity threshold for the peak detection. Default to NULL. When NULL, the user will be asked for a number. Set filter = 0 for no intensity filtering.}

\item{peakMonitor}{Logical. Are there peak to monitor throuhout the workflow? If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to NULL.}

\item{pic_extension}{Character. Pictures format to generate. Supported = '.tiff', '.png'. Default to c('.tiff', '.png').}

\item{parallel}{Character. Sort of parallelization for code to perfom. Supported are 'Serial Param', 'Snow Param', 'MultiCore Param'. For more information, check the BiocParallel R package. Default to NULL. If parallel = NULL, the user will be asked.}

\item{group}{Character. Name from 'metadata' column names to group the samples. Default to 'group'.}

\item{derivatization}{Character. Kind of derivatization the samples were prepared with. Supported are 'Trimethylsilyl' and 'None'. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to 'NULL'.}

\item{cores}{Numeric. Number of cores to be used in Snow Param. Default to NULL. If NULL, the user will be asked. Set cores = 0 to Serial Param.}

\item{column_set}{Character. Polarity of column used for the chromatography: 'polar', 'non-polar'. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to NULL.}

\item{prog}{Character. Configuration of temperature in data acquisition: 'isothermal', 'ramp', 'custom'. If NULL the user will be asked. Default to NULL.}

\item{ion_mode}{Character. Ion mode acquisition 'positive' or 'negative'. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to NULL.}

\item{plot_eic}{Logical. Plot the EIC of each of the 6 most intense m/z in the spectra. Default to NULL.}

\item{lib_build}{Logical. For lib_build == TRUE, the identified compounds will be gathered into a new internal library. Default to NULL.}

\item{RI}{Logical or path to retention index .csv file. Addition of retention index information to the spectra. If RI = TRUE, the user will be asked to provide a .csv file with 'rt' and 'RI' columns. If RI = path to the .csv files, the retention index will be calculated. Default to FALSE.}

\item{replicate}{Character or Logical. If FALSE, there is no replicate informations in the metadata table. Otherwise, inform the name in the metadata column containing replicate information. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to NULL.}

\item{mergeCompounds}{Logical. If TRUE, the user may choose from a pop-up what compounds identified should be representated as one with intensities summed. Exemple: derivatizations derivatives. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to 'NULL'.}

\item{removeCompounds}{Logical. If TRUE, the user may choose from a pop-up identified compounds to remove from the quantification table. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to 'NULL'.}

\item{info}{Logical. If TRUE, the user cann add more information to the creatin of the database, such as CAS number, PubMed and ChemSpider ID and InChiKey, among others. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default to NULL. Only required if lib_build = TRUE or NULL.}

\item{Ri}{Character. Retention index calculation method. Supported are 'lee', 'linear', 'kovats' and 'alcane'. If NULL, the user will be asked. Default ot NULL.}

\item{pre_anno}{Path to pre_anno.csv annotation file or pre_anno table. If NULL, the pre_anno.csv in the folder will be read. Default to NULL.}

\item{min_peaks}{Numeric. Minimal number of peaks a spectrum must have to be considered a viable spectrum. Default to 5.}

\item{sample_names}{Character. Name of metadata column to name the samples. Default to NULL. If NULL, the user will be asked.}

\description{
Main function for GC data processing. It read files in '.mzXML' and '.mzML' formats, apply algorithms for for peacking, grouping, retention time correction and filling missing peaks. The next step proposes spectra based on retention time window and correlation information. After annotation, the function performs quantification by normalizing data and apply t test and principal components analysis, plotting pictures for the evaluation of the steps performed. At the end, the user can choose to generate a internal library with the identified compounds to be uploaded into NIST MS Search software.
